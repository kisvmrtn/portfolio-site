      "I'm a frontend developer based in Budapest, currently focused on learning React and TypeScript. I've recently started exploring React Native as well, aiming to expand my skills into mobile app development. While I don't have professional experience yet, I'm passionate about building modern user interfaces and continuously improving my craft. During my studies, I also worked with Python and Java, which gave me a solid foundation in general programming concepts. I'm excited to grow as a developer and contribute to real-world projects.",
